This project is a simple web application built using HTML, JavaScript, and the Tailwind CSS framework. The purpose of the application is to generate strong and secure passwords based on user-defined criteria.

**Features**
**Password Generator:** The core functionality of the application is the password generator. Users can specify the length of the password and select from various character sets, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Upon clicking the "Generate" button, a random password meeting the specified criteria is generated and displayed.

**Customizable Length:** Users have the flexibility to choose the desired length of the generated password. The application allows them to set the length between a minimum and maximum limit to accommodate their specific requirements.

**Character Set Selection:** To enhance the strength and complexity of the generated passwords, users can choose from different character sets. They can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in their passwords. By enabling or disabling these options, users can tailor the generated passwords to meet their security needs.

Copy to Clipboard: To conveniently use the generated passwords, users can copy them to the clipboard with a single click. This feature saves users the hassle of manually selecting and copying the password, making it easily accessible for use in various applications.
